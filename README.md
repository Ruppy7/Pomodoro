# Pomodoro Timer App

This is a Pomodoro Timer application built using React. It allows users to manage their time effectively by using the Pomodoro Technique, which involves alternating between work and break periods.

## Features

- **Pomodoro Timer**: Set focus time, short break, and long break durations.
- **Start, Pause, and Reset**: Control the timer with start, pause, and reset buttons.
- **Settings Panel**: Adjust timer durations dynamically.
- **Responsive Design**: Works well on desktop and mobile devices.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Pomodoro/frontend
    ```

3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. Start the development server:
     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```

# Future Work
 Will add a task manager, and allow users to register and login to save their task information etc. I am thinking of achieving this via django and django rest framework mainly by creating API endpoints to which the frontend application can make calls to.


# Any and all suggestions are welcome!
